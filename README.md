This is a project from the first year of studies. The project is simulator of a world with various organisms in which you can control human, use his superpower, avoid the stronger organisms and beat the weaker ones. Each organism has a different behavior and its own strength that can change. You can also save and load your game. I also made a similar version of this project in c++ which you can find here: https://github.com/CzajaLukasz/life-game-OOP-project
